Grit is sticking with your future,\\nday in, day out, not just for the week,\\nnot just for the month, but for years, and working really hard\\nto make that future a reality. Grit is living life\\nlike it\\'s a marathon, not a sprint. A few years ago, I started studying grit\\nin the Chicago public schools. I asked thousands of high school juniors to take grit questionnaires, and then waited around more than a year to see who would graduate. Turns out that grittier kids were significantly more\\nlikely to graduate, even when I matched them\\non every characteristic I could measure, things like family income, standardized achievement test scores, even how safe kids felt\\nwhen they were at school. So it\\'s not just at West Point\\nor the National Spelling Bee that grit matters. It\\'s also in school, especially for kids\\nat risk for dropping out. To me, the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know, how little science knows,\\nabout building it. Every day, parents and teachers ask me, \"How do I build grit in kids? What do I do to teach kids\\na solid work ethic? How do I keep them motivated\\nfor the long run?\" The honest answer is, I don\\'t know. (Laughter) What I do know is that talent\\ndoesn\\'t make you gritty. Our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through\\non their commitments. In fact, in our data,\\ngrit is usually unrelated or even inversely related\\nto measures of talent. So far, the best idea I\\'ve heard\\nabout building grit in kids is something called \"growth mindset.\" This is an idea developed\\nat Stanford University by Carol Dweck, and it is the belief that the ability\\nto learn is not fixed, that it can change with your effort. Dr. Dweck has shown that when kids read\\nand learn about the brain and how it changes and grows\\nin response to challenge, they\\'re much more likely\\nto persevere when they fail, because they don\\'t believe that failure\\nis a permanent condition. So growth mindset\\nis a great idea for building grit. But we need more. And that\\'s where I\\'m going\\nto end my remarks, because that\\'s where we are. That\\'s the work that stands before us. We need to take our best ideas,\\nour strongest intuitions, and we need to test them. We need to measure\\nwhether we\\'ve been successful, and we have to be willing\\nto fail, to be wrong, to start over again with lessons learned. In other words, we need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier. Thank you. (Applause)'"
